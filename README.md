# Introduction

Designate selected hashtags as PowerTags, and see them auto-create properties are you use them. 

This only applies to tags created using `#` and does not apply to page references, block references without the `#` and blocks that have the `tag` property.

# Usage

## Creating Power Tags

1. Click on the plugin icon.
2. Enter your PowerTag, followed by the properties to assign to the PowerTag. You may also assign a default value.
3. Now the next time you use the tag, your properties will be auto-added.

## Managing Your Tags

1. Click on the plugin icon.
2. You will see a list of your created power tags.
3. Any actions performed here will affect past blocks created with the tag. For example,
   - Creating a new PowerTag
     - Does not affect past blocks with the tag.
   - Deleting a PowerTag
     - Removes all properties from blocks that have the tag, even those not created with this plugin.
   - Deleting a property of a PowerTag
     - Removes the property from blocks that have the tag, even those not created with this plugin.
   - Adding a property to an existing PowerTag
     - Adds the property to all blocks that have the tag, even those not created with this plugin.

> Important Note: Power tags are stored in the plugin settings. If the plugin settings file (found in `.logseq`) is deleted, you will need to manually create your power tags again.

# Installation

If not available from the marketplace, download the release and manually load it into Logseq after unzipping it.
